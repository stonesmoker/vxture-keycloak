# Workspace spell-check configuration

This workspace includes a `cspell.json` file and VS Code settings to reduce `cSpell` "unknown word" problems for project-specific terms.

How to apply:

1. Install the recommended extension (if prompted) or install `Code Spell Checker` (`streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker`) in VS Code.
2. Reload the window or run `Developer: Reload Window`.
3. If Problems still show old warnings, open the Problems panel and click the refresh/re-run button.

To add more project words, edit `cspell.json` and include them in the `words` array.
